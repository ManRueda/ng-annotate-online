### Running site: [ng-annotate-online](http://manrueda.github.io/ng-annotate-online/)

This project is a simple ngAnnotate implementation with a very simple UI to test small pieces of JS and check if ngAnnotate process it well.

The site use a browserified version of the NPM plugin, and works great!!

Of course many many thanks to [olov](https://github.com/olov) for the plugin.
